= JIRA Integration in Gerrit

This is a non abandoned fork of hooks-jira designed specifically for our use at the University of Auckland
doing Kanban. It primarily adds the ability to transition tickets in case they are not in the right place and
allows actions to be taken on them, currently "Set-Assigned" and "Remove-Assigned".

Actions are stored in your +etc/issue-state-transition.config+ file. They react as per the normal documentation,
however the actions are specified differently.

Actions should be of the form:

+["CurrentStatus>DestinationStatus,CurrentStatus>DestinationStatus,CurrentStatus>Destination>Destination"]+

It will ask  the ticket for its current status and check to see what states your list might wish to transition to and
then ask the ticket what states it *can* transition to.

Once it has transitioned, it will again ask the ticket for its current status and where it can transition to, then
check your list and determine what to do. Once it runs out of transitions, it stops.

Order of precedence is left to right.

+["Development Done>Review Doing|Set-Assigned,Development Doing>Development Done"]+

It will query the current status and find it is in +Development Doing+. It can transition to +Design Done+,
+Development Done+ or +Closed+. It looks through the transitions, sees +Development Doing+ and migrates to
 +Development Done+. Then it asks the ticket what its status is, and where it can move to, which includes +Review
 Doing+. This matches the first option, so the status is set to +Review Doing+ and the current person (the reviewer
 presumably) is set to the Assignee.

In our workflow, we typically have these situations:

* Review Patchset created, moved ticket to +Development Done+
* Draft Patchset created, moved ticket to +Development Doing+
* Reviewer starts reviewing patchset, moved ticket to +Review Doing+, assign to reviewer
* Patchset +2'd, moved ticket to +Review Done+, unassign reviewer
* Patchset merged, moved ticket to +Merged+
* Patchset fails review (-1, 0, +1), moved ticket to +Development Doing+
* Patchset bomb, move ticket to +Design Doing+

This turns up as
